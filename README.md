# obsidian Timelines
Generate a chronological timeline of all notes with the specified set of tags. 

## Examples

#### Timeline with interpretation (1 row)

#### Vertical Timeline

#### Horizantal Timeline

## Inserting a Timeline Event

VIDEO BRIEF EXAMPLE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gtpZDXWcrM

VAULT FROM THE EXAMPLE TO QUICLY START TIMELINE WITH INTERPRETATIONS: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1odAg1VX4Ai8zlBmSafRueZ4AJhTUvkKc?usp=share_link

1. Add the `timeline` tag to the note, either in the YAML frontmatter or somewhere else (a note without a timeline tag is ignored when building a timeline).
2. or a timeline HTML comment for static rendering.

### Using a Timeline code block for dynamic rendering

Create the following code block where a timeline is to be inserted using: `timeline` or `timeline-vis` or `timeline-with-interpretations`

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines/main/images/example_1.png)

the render block takes a single input which is the list of tags by which to filter timeline tagged notes (e.g. in the above example block, ONLY notes with all three tags `timeline`, `test` and `now`). this can be used to filter battles only with a note tagged `timeline` and `war` for example or birthdays using `timeline` and `birthday` for the single input.

### Using a Timeline inline code block for static rendering

Using an HTML code block, insert the following HTML comment where a statically rendered timeline should be inserted:
```
<!--TIMELINE BEGIN tags='test;now'--><!--TIMELINE END-->
```
(this is rendering notes that have both tags: test, now appiled to it)

Use the Timelines: Render Timeline command to generate a timeline statically. Running the command again will replace everything between the two comments (BEGIN/END) with a freshly rendered timeline. Changes will not be detected using this method, but as it is creating static HTML, the generated content will work and readable without Obsidian.

## Timeline Tagging a note

The note will be ignored in the following cases:
- no `timeline` tag (or the modified tag from the settings)
- Note does not contain all the tags from the search list
- No timeline `<span>` or `<div>` info block, or frontmatter(YAML) to pull from
- The used date is not VALID, must be in the following format YEAR-MONTH-DAY-MINUTES (check info section below for more details)

## Timeline Event Properties

Timeline events must specify the following: 
- a valid date, YEAR-MONTH-DAY-HOURS:MINUTES (check info section below for more details)
- a valid class, specifically `ob-timelines` must be specified.
All other fields are optional.
Invalid timeline events will be skipped.

### Timeline Entry

There are 2 ways to register a note with the timeline: Frontmatter or HTML tags. If HTML tags are included in the note,
they will be used. Otherwise the timeline with default to gathering data from the frontmatter.

#### Method 1: Frontmatter

```markdown
---
start-date: 2018-01-18
end-date: 2018-03-02
type: range
color: blue(defalult if not provided) 
tags: [timeline, personal]
title: My Note Title(otherwise uses the title of the note by default)
description: (can be used to add subtext under the title)
---
```
![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReconVirus/obsidian-timelines/main/images/Colors.png)
Color supports `green`, `gray`, `orange`, `pink`, `purple`,`red`, `yellow`, `white`, and blue by default if color is not provided in the frontmatter.
You can add any other colors you want in a CSS snippet with the following example rule:

```CSS
.vis-item.purple {
  background-color: rgb(139, 195, 74);
  filter: none;
  border-color: #628934;
}
.vis-item.vis-selected.purple {
  /* custom colors for selected orange items */
  background-color: rgba(139, 195, 74, 0.7);
  border-color: rgba(98, 137, 52, 0.7);
}
```

Supported `types` are:
- range
- box
- background
- point

#### Method 2: HTML

A timeline entry can be created using a `<span></span>` or `<div></div>` tag, with the following attributes: 

```html
<span 
	  class='ob-timelines' 
	  data-date='2000-10-10' 
	  data-title='Another Event' 
	  data-class='orange' 
	  data-img = 'Timeline Example/Timeline_2.jpg' 
	  data-type='range' 
	  data-end='2000-10-20'> 
	A second event! (this would be used as the description for the timeline event card)
</span>
```
Timeline span and div entries (.ob-timelines class) are hidden in preview by default, however, if you wish to display content, try a snippet like this: 
```css
/* Render the ob-timelines span or div elements as inline blocks that use an italic font */
.ob-timelines {
  display: inline-block !important;
  font-style: italic;
}
/* Use the before pseudo element to display attributes of the span or div */
.ob-timelines::before {
  content: "ðŸ”– " attr(data-date) ": " attr(data-title) ". ";
  color: lilac;
  font-weight: 500;
}
```
Using the above snippet, a span like this: 
```html
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='1499-03-28' data-title="An example"></span>
```
would be rendered as: 
<img width="228" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/808713/159139934-e5c7cb5a-da31-4a57-8100-946f944010a3.png">

## Interpretations

Interpretions are created in separate notes. To create an interjection to an event already described correctly in another article, you should:
1) Create a note for interpretation
2) Add tags to the beginning of the note 
```Markdown
---
Tags: timeline, pr-lang
---
```
3) Add span or div tag to this note
```HTML
<span 
   class='ob-timelines-interpretation' 
   data-date='2004-01-02-12:55' 
   data-event_title='Event_title' 
   data-class='pr-lang' 
   data-interpretation_number='3'
   data-title='Interpretation_title'
   > 
</span>
```

### Timeline with interpretations settings
- You can customize the display for yourself.
![[Timeline with interpretations settings.png]]

## Timeline Span block
- Hidden in preview by default in order to keep the note clean

### Date
- The most important and essential info, if it is not valid the note will be ignored

- Valid date format: 
  - `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-HOURS:MINUTES` or `YEAR-MONTH-DAY` or `-YEAR-MONTH-DAY-HOURS:MINUTES` or `-YEAR-MONTH-DAY`
  - Here, the YEAR in front of which the `-` symbol stands will be interpreted as the YEAR of BC, and without a sign the YEAR will be integrated as AD
  - YEAR may range from -9999 to 9999 for example `-1234`
  - MONTH may range from 01 to 12 for example `05`
  - DAY and HOUR and MINUTES may range from 00 to 99 for example
  - Exemples: `2004-04-02-13:40` or `2004-04-02` or `-2004-04-02-13:40` or `-2004-04-02`
  - **if your input time is not valid the plugin will not check that**

### Title:
  - Optional
  - If a title is not specified the name of the note will be used

### Description:
  - Optional
  - If a description is not specified an empty section will be shown

### Background Image:
  - Optional
  - If an image is not specified no image will be shown (just text)
  - If an invalid url is given (an empty black section will be seen for that note card)
  - Currently only `http` & `absolute local path` will render, in the current obsidian release of `v0.10.13` obsidian links for background images are blocked from rendering, hopefully it is promised that this will be removed in the upcuming release. 

### CSS Class:
  - Optional
  - Adds the applied css class to the note card associated with this span info block

## Timeline Interpretation Span block
- Hidden in preview by default in order to keep the note clean

### Date
- The date of the event should coincide with the date of the interpretation, and in general the rules are the same

### Event_title
- The name of the event for which this note is interpretation. That is, the Title in event should present the Event-title in interpretation

### interpretation_number
- Whole chili. They collectively determine the order of interpretation

### Title
  - Optional
  - if the title is not present, it is assumed that `Interpretation â„–{interpretation_number}`
